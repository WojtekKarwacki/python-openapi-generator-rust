make all methods take &var instead of var, clone on call only when needed
try to get rid of redundant clones

use pub(crate) for package private access


open_api:
more typesafe open_api (look for open_api in; .rs on gh)

some other time:
research if handlebars support global variables used for the whole template, @origin, @formLike etc. may be used
schema _ref property is handled in RefOr, use only RefOr everywhere
https://docs.rs/serde_with/3.4.0/serde_with/attr.skip_serializing_none.html
abstract python gen
use !isPrimitive (or like) instead of type == obj | seq | map
with_mapped_all_of etc. create an intermediary type that is not clear to the reader, consider creating specialized schema type for that
