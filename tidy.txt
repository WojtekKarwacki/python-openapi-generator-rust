make all methods take &var instead of var, clone on call only when needed

try to get rid of redundant clones
use pub(crate) for package private access
think about renaming origin/paarent to something resembling src/path
expose FeatureName variable and add Dto, Service to it and use it everywhere instead of separate variable for Dto/Service and so on
cleanup all fmt_ref, fmt_class methods, rethinkg what shohuld be responsible for what
rethink all methods in gen, all of them should be used externally, otherwise they are implementation specific

open_api:
more typesafe open_api (look for open_api in; .rs on gh)

some other time:
schema _ref property is handled in RefOr, use only RefOr everywhere
https://docs.rs/serde_with/3.4.0/serde_with/attr.skip_serializing_none.html
abstract python gen
use !isPrimitive (or like) instead of type == obj | seq | map
with_mapped_all_of etc. create an intermediary type that is not clear to the reader, consider creating specialized schema type for that
